## What is the Adapter Pattern?
It allows incompatible interfaces to work together. 
It acts as a bridge between two different interfaces, making them compatible without modifying their existing code.

## Real-Life Example: New Robotic System
Imagine you are developing an Robotic system. Your system supports new Robot functionality 
by utilising the legacy Robot behviour without changing any behaviour of legacy Robot


## Benefits of Using Adapter Pattern
✅ Decouples client code from third-party APIs
✅ Provides a consistent interface for different implementations
✅ Makes future integrations easier without changing existing business logic

This pattern is widely used in integrating external libraries, legacy code, and third-party services 
in .NET Core microservices and applications.
