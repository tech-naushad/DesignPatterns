## What is the Adapter Pattern?
It allows incompatible interfaces to work together. 
It acts as a bridge between two different interfaces, making them compatible without modifying their existing code.

## Real-Life Example: Payment Gateway Integration
Imagine you are developing an e-commerce system in .NET Core. Your system supports payments, 
but different payment providers (PayPal, Stripe, etc.) have different APIs. 
You need a common interface to handle all payment gateways seamlessly.

## Benefits of Using Adapter Pattern
✅ Decouples client code from third-party APIs
✅ Provides a consistent interface for different implementations
✅ Makes future integrations easier without changing existing business logic

This pattern is widely used in integrating external libraries, legacy code, and third-party services in .NET Core microservices and applications.
